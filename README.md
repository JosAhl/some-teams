# Some Teams #

"Some Teams" was the first coding assignment that was given to the Web Developer class at Yrgo 2024.
They were given a php file with an array of soccer teams that they would - produce a webpage for to display - display on a webpage.

The project included a set of **9 requirements** to follow when building your webpage:

- The data you will be using is in *data.php*.

- Your web site should contain a *start page* and a *about page*.

- The *about page* should have information about you, the creator.

- The *start page* should be constructed with at least three different .php files, and should display the teams listed in *data.php*. Feel free to list them how you like.

- The project should not print any HTML within PHP strings.

- The project should not include any coding errors, warning or notices.

- The repository should have at least 7 commits and not just one big commit.

- The repository should contain a *README.md* file with information about the project (usually a *README.md* includes information about what the project is about, how it's made, about the author, install instructions if any and such stuff)

- The repository should contain a *LICENSE* file. Preferably MIT.

## Approach ##

I started building my webpage by following one of the requirements, to divide the start page in 3 different php files.
Therefore my code is divided in 3 for the start page, one about page and one with the array we were given to display, a total of 5 php files and 1 css file.
Through simple paragraphs, a foreach loop and a grid system I was able to produce a webpage that conveyed what was necessary and that would hopefully add some interesting visuals.

## Author ##

I have limited experience in coding, mainly adjusting hex values in HTML on some early 2000s blog site. I am just starting out and aim to create engaging and interactive websites for both fun and educational purposes in the future. I am eager to explore the field while maintaining achievable goals, and gradually build my knowledge along the way.

## Installation ##

There should be no installations needed as fonts, images and links are provided through URL or the files within the site.
